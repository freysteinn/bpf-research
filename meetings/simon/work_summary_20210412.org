* PPing
- Not much has happend
- Have changed "u8-check" for *opt_size* after Toke pointed out that the &= 0x3f could lead to incorrect processing of malformed packets
  - Declared as volatile in attempt to allow &= 0xff check
  - No check needed as using volatile seemed to cause variable always being read as u8 from stack
  - Maybe better to declare as u16 and have &= 0xff check?
  - Lead to discovery of [[PPing: Failed packet access check][other issue]]
- Have added *opt_size* > 1 check for better processing of malformed packets
** PPing: Failed packet access check
#+BEGIN_SRC C
if (opt == 8 && opt_size == 10) {
	if (pos + opt_size > opt_end || pos + opt_size > data_end)
		return -1;
	*tsval = *(__u32 *)(pos + 2);
	*tsecr = *(__u32 *)(pos + 6);
	return 0;
}
#+END_SRC
- Verifier disliked packet access, not convinced pos + opt_size > pos + 2 or 6
- When *opt_size* was not volatile, compiler replaced pos + opt_size with pos + 10
  - ...so I simply did the same replacement in the source code

* Other
- Been quite busy with "other" stuff last couple of weeks
- *Info ret:* Spent a lot of time writing up final version of report
  - Still not entirely happy, but think it's "good enough"
- *ISP:* Spent some time writing 2nd/3rd draft, close to done?
- *GUI course:* TA in area I have little experience with, spent some time reading up on material
- *AIDA meetings:* Had AIDA meeting before easter, two more this week
