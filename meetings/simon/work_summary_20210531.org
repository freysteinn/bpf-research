* Institutional duty
- Mostly done with the GUI course
- Just some delayed handins and returns left to correct
- Jonathan also wants us to help correcting an assignment if we have the time
  - A bit unsure how much time I've actually spent on the course
  - Think I can help as long as I limit the amount of feedback I provide

* Courses
- Will hold DISCO seminar on URLLC on Friday this week
- Need to prepare and practice a bit for approx 30 min presentation
- Also attend PhD defense as part of introduction course

* PPing
- Mainly some code fixes/cleanup
- Now using JSON library (stolen from iproute) instead of giant printf
  - By default no longer has any spacing in JSON format (more efficent but harder to read)
  - Could add a pretty-print option
- Still need to add the start/end-of-flow messages
  - Need to think a bit about how to do this in a generic way
** PPing - IP anonymization
- Have started to look into it a little bit
- Turns out it's a whole research area of its own
  - Many different methods, and uncertainties of how safe they are
- Think methods have to provide a 1-to-1 mapping to be relevant
  - I.e. methods that "groups" addresses (usually truncate) will make analysis hard
  - Nice part with truncation methods is that it still keeps some network information, ex. approx location
- Do we need to consider ISPs data policy (GDPR)?
  - Otherwise, maybe utalize less anonymization at collection time, and run second run of anonymization before publishing?
** PPing - Performance test
- We've also talked about creating some performance benchmark for pping
  - Compare it against Kathie's pping
  - Hopefully show that it has low enough overhead that you can always have in on
- Haven't really spent much thought/effort on this yet
- General setup of this?
  - Single machine: Just run traffic over virtual interfaces
    - Pros: "Easy" to set up, can have very high link speeds
    - Cons: Traffic generation will also impact system
  - Multiple machines
    - Pros: More "realistic", can have dedicated pping machine
    - Cons: More complex to set up, physical link speed limitation, need hardware with XDP drivers

* Meetings with Muhammad Usman
- Last time we were generally in favor of using these meetings to coordinate our work rather than setting up separate meetings
  - Also wanted input from Anna
- Anything else we need to discuss regarding this?

* Vacation
- Plan to take my vacation w 29-31, 34
  - Is this problematic for anyone involved?
- When will others have vaction?
- How do we handle these meetings during summer?

* Other
- AIDA meeting tomorrow
  - Not really anything from our side?

- Toke has introduced me to Dave That
  - They may have some interest in pping, will present it in meeting
  - Either tomorrow or next week

- What do I do with the "How to get a PhD" book?

* Plan
- Complete URLLC presentation
  - And of course host seminar on Friday
- Handle delayed labs and returns in GUI course
  - Maybe also correct assignment 2
- Attend AIDA meeting
- Attend Cristian's PhD defense
- Attend meeting with David That (tomorrow or next week)
- pping:
  - Add start/end-of-flow messages
  - Continue looking at IP anonymization
