* Mobile and Wireless
- Have created worksheet 3
  - Redid final question after feedback from Andreas
  - Took about 1.5 days to do exercises+solutions
- This week I will hold live session for sheet 2 and grade it
  - Should take about 1 (long-ish) day
* Information retrieval
- Had two lectures last week (of which one was almost a full day)
- A fair bit of required background reading/video watching
- Spent about 2.5-ish days total
  - Included a little bit of time (1-2 hours) to also practice the material
  - "Wasted" 1-2 hours on searching and playing around with tools for creating citation maps (not part of course)
- This week another three lectures (3h+2h+2h)
  - Also a fair bit of background reading
  - Expect it to take about 2 days
- Last lecture, only seminar+examination task left
  - Expect load to decrease a bit
* Computer Networks revision
- Got the proof plus several forms to fill for the publication
- Forms include publishing format, license and colours for figures
  - Open access costs about €2000, and another €500 for every figure in colour
  - I'm at this stage very unsure about these types of questions
  - Have contacted Johan Garcia about it, but not gotten a response yet
- Spent about 3-ish hours on it so far
  - Will hopefully not need to spend a significant amount of additional time on it
* PPing
- Not much time left to work on this...
- The IPv6 and no entry for pure ACKs fixes have been merged
- Thinking about how to approach the rate limiting we talked about last week
  - Andreas suggested probabilistic approach
    - Could be extended to configure across multiple devices
    - Seems complex to me
    - Not familiar with the probibalistic data structures and how they map to BPF
  - Think I will initially go with the time-based sampling we've talked about previously
    - Only allow for one entery every ex. 100ms per flow
    - Allow users to configure this
    - This should treat all flows relativly "fairly" regardless of intensity
** Rate limiting: Implementation
- Plan to keep "global" (not per-CPU) map of last entry for each flow (source+dest addresses)
  - Per-CPU maps faster, but each CPU has its own state
  - Use flow as key, timestamp of last entry as value
    - Before adding entry, check time since last entry was added
- Concurrency issues with "global" maps
  - Would possibly result in small bursts being allowed
  - Could overwrite last timestamp (but would be with a very similar timestamp)
  - These should be relativly OK?
    - Adding atomic operations/locks affects performance and makes it more complicated
** Rate limiting: Allowing bursts
- Would probably be good to allow shorter bursts
  - Partly to deal with delayed ACKs (may not get a match if only creating entry for "first" packet)
  - Not entierly sure how to best handle this
    - Could store multiple timestamps in value
      - Burst size needs to be known at compile time
    - Could add a counter in value
      - Would potentially further amplify concurrency issues
    - Let the concurrency issues be the solution (doesn't seem reliable)
** Rate limiting examples
- Keeping multiple timestamps
  #+begin_SRC C
  struct last_entry {
      __u64 timestamp1;
      __u64 timestamp2;
  } le;

  if (now - le.timestamp1 < 100ms && now - le.timestamp2 < 100ms)
      abort;
  #+end_SRC
- Burst counter
  #+begin_SRC C
  struct last_entry {
      __u64 timestamp;
      __u8 burst_count;
  } le;

  if (now - le.timestamp < 100ms && le.burst_count >= MAX_BURST)
      abort;
  #+end_SRC
** Graceful degradation
- Current way already works ok?
- Maybe automatically increase rate limit as map gets full?
* Plan
- Attend info-ret lectures and do background reading
  - Also get started on examination task
- Correct Mobile and Wireless exercise 2 (and host live session)
- Implement discussed rate limiting in PPing
- Put away a few hours to start working with the ISP
* Student-Supervisor expectations
- My points are avilable at [[https://www.overleaf.com/read/bcjmgsjmppcb][Overleaf]]
- Maybe also discuss if my supervisors should fulfill different roles?
