* PPing
- Have added a JSON format and Kathie's "machine friendly"/ppviz format
  - Kathie's format was very easy to implement, so why not?
- Have added timestamps and minimum-RTTs to all formats
  - Have also added protocol and packets/bytes sent/received to JSON output
- Have opened [[https://github.com/xdp-project/bpf-examples/pull/16][PR]]
- Have also started discussion on measurement study: [[https://github.com/xdp-project/bpf-examples/pull/17][PR]]

** PPing: Current JSON format
Actual format
#+BEGIN_SRC json
{"timestamp":1620639563.930289461, "rtt":0.000006753, "min_rtt":0.000006753, "src_ip":"10.11.1.1", "src_port":5201, "dest_ip":"10.11.1.2", "dest_port":48856, "protocol":"TCP", "sent_pkts":7798, "sent_bytes":342275968, "rec_pkts":5195, "rec_bytes":37 }

- Thoughts on format?
- Any additional fields to add?

** PPing: Discussion on measurement study
- Plan is to use pping for some measurement study
- Publish paper on pping + measurement results
- Have opened [[https://github.com/xdp-project/bpf-examples/pull/17][PR]] to discuss some aspects of collecting measurements
  - Contains a [[https://github.com/simosund/bpf-examples/blob/Measurement_study/pping/MEASUREMENT_STUDY.md][document]] that currently mainly outlines some open questions
  - Plan to update the document with decisions
  - Would appreciate input from others

** PPing: Some measurement considerations
 - What info do we need?
   - Anything beyond what is captured in the current JSON format?
 - Can we use local storage?
 - How much traffic can we send to remote storage?
 - Do we need to filter out some traffic?
 - We should probably anonymize IP-addresses
   - When should this be done?
   - Do we still want some geographical information?
   - Public vs private addresses?
   - Also anonymize ports?
 - What to analyze?
   - RTT fluctuations
   - RTT correlation to ex. traffic or distance

* Other
- GUI course
  - Lab 2 corrected, lab 3 to be handed in 23/5
  - Couple of delayed or returned assignments drop in

- DISCO reading course
  - My seminar on URLLC moved up to next slot
