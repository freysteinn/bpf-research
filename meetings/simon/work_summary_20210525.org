* PPing
- Not much has happend since last time
- Fixed issue where only single instance of pping could run at a time
  - Think I forgot to mention in last Red Hat meeting
- There are a number of smaller fixes I need to work on
  - Both some code cleanup and JSON format improvments

** PPing: Single instance fix
- To ensure pping is always loaded with libbpf, tc program is loaded and pinned from userspace program
  - tc command only attaches pinned program, instead of loading it itself
- Was pinning program to ~/sys/fs/bpf/pping/classifier~
- Only removed pinned program on shutdown
- If you try to start pping again (on ex. another interface), it will fail to pin tc program as location is already occupied
- Fix was to simply unpin tc program as soon as it has been attached

** PPing: Protocol in JSON format
- Have added a ~protocol~ field (will currently only be ~"TCP"~)
- Should ~protocol~ always be layer 4/transport protocol?
  - Say we add support for QUIC (over UDP), should protocol then be "QUIC" or "UDP"?
  - Say we add support for TCP based on seq/ACK numbers, should protocol still only be "TCP"?
- Could either try to extend ~protocol~ field, ex:
  - ~"protocol": "TCP Timestamp"~
  - ~"protocol": "ICMP Echo"~
- Or add "identifier_type", ex:
  - ~"protocol": "TCP", "identifier_type": "timestamp"~
  - ~"protocol": "ICMP", "identifier_type": "echo"~
  - ~"protocol": "UDP", "identifier_type": "QUIC spinbit"~

** PPing: Flow start and end notifications
- Last meeting we briefly discussed adding some type of message when flow starts/ends
- For start, is it only when we see SYN-flag or whenever we have no previous flow-state?
- For end, is it only when we see RST/FIN flag, or also when garbage collected?

* Institutional duty
- Deadline for lab 3 was last week
- Need to correct lab 3 this week
  - In general I probably also have to become more efficent at correcting
  - Often spend ​~1h and write ​~500 words of feedback per correction
- Today was last supervision session

* Courses
- Will hold seminar on URLLC next week in DISCO reading course
- Have read up on subject, selected papers and prepared discussion questions
- Still have to prepare the actual presentation


* Plan
- Correct lab 3 in GUI course
- Have initial draft of URLLC presentation
- pping:
  - Some code cleanup
  - Use JSON builder instead of giant printf
  - Some changes to JSON format (mainly use ints instead of floats)
  - Find some time to look at network data sets
