* Mobile and Wireless
- The first exercise sheet has been handed in
  - There were some minor issues with the exercises
  - Had accidently written MHz instead of Hz on one question
    - Still worked, just got some odd answers
  - Two questions could potentially be missinterpreted
- Holding live session + correcting was almost possible in a (long) day
* Computer Networks revision
- Spent most of week 5 on it (and submitted around 22:00 on Friday)
- Got notified yesterday that it's accepted for publication
* PPing
- Have added IPv6 support
  - Maps IPv4 address to IPv6 addresses as previously talked about
  - Had in interesting issue with a constant being moved to .rodata
    - Supported by libbpf, but not by iproute2 (without libbpf support)
    - Thanks Toke for finding the issue and clearing up my confusion
- Have refactored code in XDP/TC programs
  - Now reuse all the parsing logic for TC/XDP
  - Should be relativly straightforward to add support for other protocols now
** PPing - issue with reporting incorrect RTT
- In my inital demo it reported mostly 100ms RTT when adding 30ms of delay
- Figured out what caused this issue
  - I had setup my testing in a retarded way
  - Was using iperf to generate TCP flow
  - Was running PPing on the iperf server side - only sends ACKs
    - Was measuring time between ACK being sent and next packet from client (after client as recieved the ACK)
    - Was telling iperf client to only send at 10 Mbps to limit printouts from pping - delay between sending packets
- Have worked on a fix to not create map entries for pure ACKs
** PPing - some discussion
- What do we want to support?
  - Currently supports iproute both with and without libbpf
    - Have to declare ts_start map three times (?)
    - Had to go with less clear option for the IPv4 to IPv6 mapping
  - Kernel version, BTF etc.
    - Currently use loops, function calls etc. (instead of unrolling, inlining etc)
    - For future, use global variables instead of map lookups etc.
** PPing - what's next?
- [[https://github.com/simosund/bpf-examples/blob/pping_IPv6/pping/TODO.md][TODO list]] is kinda long - what do focus on next?
  - Rate limit for adding entries
  - Automatic delete of unique identifiers
  - Track min RTT
    - Use per-CPU hashmap
    - Reset after some timeout?
  - Add seq/ack fallback for TCP?
  - Add new protocol (ICMP echo/reply should be easy)
* Courses
- Information Retrieval
  - Have written introduction and read course litterature for this tomorrow's lecture
- Intro to PhD course
  - Have written [[https://www.overleaf.com/read/bcjmgsjmppcb][supervisor interaction "contract"]]
* Plan
- Create worksheet 3 for Mobile and Wireless
- Attend lectures and do associated work for Information Retrieval
  - Expect this to eat up around 2 days this week
- Continue hacking away on PPing
  - Feature may depend on discussion, but thinking rate limit to start with
