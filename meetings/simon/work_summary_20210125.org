* Reading
- Have finished "How to get a PhD"
  - Not read chapters 12-13 (for supervisors)
- Have only skimmed through article forwarded by Simone
  - Seems like a very good overview of eBPF/XDP
  - Probably know a lot of it already, but rehersal is good
* PPing
- Have initiated pull request to the [[https://github.com/xdp-project/bpf-examples/pull/7][xdp-project/bpf-examples]] repo
  - Got some very helpful feedback from Toke
  - Have adressed the initial feedback points
- Had some issues with converting to BTF-defined maps
  - Assumed it required kernel support
    - Updated to Ubuntu 20.10 which has kernel configured with BTF
  - Tried running XDP program in traffic-pacing-edt
    - Error message complained about missing/corrupt BTF
    - I assumed the issue was kernel BTF support
    - ...however was due to BTF-section being stripped from ELF object
- Plan to add IPv6 support next
* Revison of Computer Networks journal article
- Got a revision of an article I and Johan Garcia submitted 2020-10-13
- Wrote while working as project assistent in HITS
- Based on my previous work for locating cellular base stations
  - collaboration with Icomera
- Reviewers request minor revisions
  - ...although stated as major revision in system
  - Largely related to clarification of limitations for proposed method
- Current status
  - Had an initial meeting with co-author/supervisor Johan Garica
  - Have planned how to handle most comments

* Rethink "[[https://www.kau.se/rethink/studier/folj-en-doktorand]["Follow a PhD-student"]] Workshop
- Project aimed at improving administrative processes for PhD students

  - Interesting to see other PhDs and their thoughts
  - "Kurstorget" will be reworked

  - Apparently fully booked this year
  - Frey will also attend this course
- Any info on DISCO literature study course?
* Graduate school
