* Mobile and Wireless
- Have finished final (4th) [[https://www.overleaf.com/read/jqsyftkqsvwz][worksheet]]
  - Exercises from previous years didn't fit that well with course material
  - Had to come up with more exercises on my own
  - Got a couple of items to revise from Andreas
  - Overall took about 1.3 days (scheduled 1 day for it)
- Will host exercise 3 session on Wednesday (10/3)
- Estimate I've overworked somewhat in terms of hours, but not in days
* Information Retrieval
- Examination task
  - A 5000 word report on search and publication strategy
  - Started a little (3-4h) last week
  - First draft should be handed in by 15/3
  - Will need to spend a bit more time this week
- Will have meeting with topic librarian tomorrow (9/3)
* DISCO reading
- Had first seminar (on network slicing in 5G) today
  - Think Alexander had a very nice high-level presentation of the topic
  - Overall pretty nice discussion
  - Didn't really follow the discussion questions that closely
- Background reading
  - 3 fairly high-level papers
  - More on concept rather than technical details
  - Good selection for someone not that familiar with the topic
- Overall, spent about 1 day with reading+questions before the seminar
* PPing: progress
- Updated [[https://github.com/simosund/bpf-examples/blob/pping_Add_Sampling/pping/SAMPLING_DESIGN.md][documentation]] with some of our discussions from Red Hat meeting
- Have pushed initial implementation of rate limiting to [[https://github.com/xdp-project/bpf-examples/pull/13][PR]]
  - Missing user configuration
  - Missing flow cleanup
  - Missing burst capabilities
  - Missing output rate limit
- Have changed procedure for loading tc-program
  - Used to both load and attach with tc command
  - Capabilities would differ based on if iproute had libbpf support or not
  - Now load and pin from userspace program (libbpf), and only attach with tc command
  - Zero documentation that this is possible
    - I should probably document it...
** PPing: Upcomming
- Flow cleanup
  - From userspace - periodically remove connections with no recent activity
  - From BPF - remove closed connections
    - On RST - remove immediately
    - On FIN - close immediatley (easy), or try and track 4-way handshake?
- Bursts
  - Nr packets? 2 should be enough for delayed ACK? Toke suggested ex. 3
  - Duration - should only allow burst in short time window - how short?
    - Shorter than rate limit
    - Definitly shorter than delayed ACK (500 ms)
- Rate limit output
  - To avoid multiple printouts from burst
  - Timelimit
    - Shorter than sampling limit
    - Higher than burst limit
** PPing: Future improvments
- [[http://doi.org/10.1145/3405669.3405823][Paper]] linked by Andreas uses hierarchical hash tables with lazy expiery
- The lazy expiery part would be nice to have here
  - Currently loop through and delete old entries
  - Instead, simply overwrite old entries on hash collision
  - Would probably have to implement own hash-table
    - Store it in simple BPF ARRAY map instead
* Other
- ISP
  - Have briefly looked it through, filled in a few things
  - Need to actually get it done soon-ish
    - A bit over 4 months since I started
- Recently got a mail about the course [[http://libra.sae.kau.se/course/philosophy-and-theory-science-doctoral-students-vetenskapsteori-doktorander][Philosophy and Theory of Science for doctoral students]]
  - Part of course plan
  - Takes place between 5/4-21/5
  - Should probably sign up for it (deadline 26/3)?
- How many points is the DISCO reading course?
  - Future instances?
- Brief discussion with Johan about Institutional duties
  - Will likely do graphical user interfaces next
  - Don't have much relevant experience, so will have to schedule hours accordingly
* Plan
- Have [[https://www.overleaf.com/read/bcjmgsjmppcb][student-supervisor expecations]] discussion
- Finish first draft of InfoRet examination task
  - Also have topic librarian meeting
- Host mobile & wireless [[https://www.overleaf.com/read/hrbygxygjchw][session 3]]
- PPing map cleanup and user configuration
  - Try and squeeze in some documentation as well
  - Don't think I'll have time for burst handling this week
- Maybe also work some on the ISP?
