* Mobile and Wireless
- Have finished the second exercise sheet
  - Will run between 10/2 to 24/2
- Will try to finish 3rd exercise sheet this week
- I'm currently overspending time on this
  - Try to get work with exercise sheets done early to handle load later
* Computer Networks article
- Gotten a revision on a journal article to Computer Networks
- Several comments to address and minor fixes in paper
- Making changes and proofreading 18-page paper takes considerable time
  - Good writing practice
* PPing
- Have gotten great continuous feedback from Toke
  - Still have a couple of fixes left
    - Slow progress due to work on Mobile & Wireless + Computer Networks
  - Probably close to merge ready(?)
- Outline of changes done
  - Fixes to format/styling of code + commit messages
  - Cleanup of tc and map on program exit
  - Switched to BTF-defined map for XDP program
    - Can use libbpf functionality to automatically pin map using the pinning attribute
    - Attempts to use BTF-defined map for tc as well if iproute has libbpf support
      - Based on Jesper's [[https://github.com/simosund/bpf-examples/blob/76060f0cb865ace20a3d7138796eda6e93986096/traffic-pacing-edt/edt_pacer_vlan.c#L61-L84][traffic-pacing-edt/edt_pacer_vlan.c]]
      - Not tested, may not work correctly for pinned maps?
  - Various other minor fixes
* Plan
- Right now working hard on the Computer Networks revision
- Will adress Toke's change request "soon" (later today or tomorrow)
- Will try to squeeze in the third exercise sheet for Mobile & Wireless
- Spend a little bit of time preparing for Information retrieval course
- Write up "contract" for supervisor interaction
  - Anna was supposed to provide an example
